#  This module will create a file that scrap for jobs from some of the main job searching websites
#  Based on experience and habbit, I choose to use Indeed and Workopolis
#  
# Design thinking: 
# What are the key words, how to filter for information that I need
# Which language shall I use? Is SQL a better choice for storing data?
